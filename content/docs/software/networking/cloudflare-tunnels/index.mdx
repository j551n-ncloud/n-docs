# Cloudflare Tunnels

Cloudflare Tunnels provide secure, encrypted connections to your homelab services from anywhere in the world without opening ports on your firewall or exposing your home IP address.

<Callout type="info">
Cloudflare Tunnels eliminate the need for port forwarding, dynamic DNS, or VPN setups while providing enterprise-grade security and performance.

## What are Cloudflare Tunnels?

Cloudflare Tunnels create secure, outbound-only connections from your infrastructure to Cloudflare's edge network. This approach offers several advantages:

### Key Benefits

- **No Port Forwarding**: Services remain behind your firewall
- **Hide Origin IP**: Your home IP address stays private
- **Built-in DDoS Protection**: Cloudflare's network protects your services
- **SSL/TLS Termination**: Automatic HTTPS with Cloudflare certificates
- **Global Performance**: Cloudflare's CDN accelerates your services
- **Access Control**: Granular authentication and authorization policies

### How It Works

```
[Your Services] ←→ [cloudflared] ←→ [Cloudflare Edge] ←→ [Internet Users]
```

1. **cloudflared** daemon runs on your server
2. Creates secure tunnel to Cloudflare's edge network
3. Cloudflare routes traffic to your services through the tunnel
4. Users access your services via Cloudflare's global network

## Use Cases

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Cloudflare account (free tier available)
- Domain managed by Cloudflare
- Server or container to run cloudflared
- Services to expose (web apps, APIs, etc.)

### Basic Setup Process
1. **Install cloudflared** on your server
2. **Authenticate** with your Cloudflare account
3. **Create a tunnel** and get credentials
4. **Configure ingress rules** for your services
5. **Start the tunnel** and test connectivity
6. **Set up DNS records** to route traffic

## Configuration Examples

### Basic Web Service
```yaml
tunnel: my-tunnel-id
credentials-file: /path/to/credentials.json

ingress:
  - hostname: app.example.com
    service: http://localhost:8080
  - service: http_status:404
```

### Docker Services
```yaml
ingress:
  - hostname: web.example.com
    service: http://web-container:80
  - hostname: api.example.com
    service: http://api-container:3000
  - service: http_status:404
```

### Multiple Services
```yaml
ingress:
  - hostname: nextcloud.example.com
    service: http://localhost:8080
  - hostname: plex.example.com
    service: http://localhost:32400
  - hostname: grafana.example.com
    service: http://localhost:3000
  - service: http_status:404
```

## Management and Monitoring

### Cloudflare Dashboard
- Tunnel status and health
- Traffic analytics and metrics
- Access logs and audit trails
- Configuration management

### Command Line Tools
```bash
# List all tunnels
cloudflared tunnel list

# Check tunnel status
cloudflared tunnel info my-tunnel

# View tunnel logs
cloudflared tunnel logs my-tunnel

# Test tunnel connectivity
cloudflared tunnel test my-tunnel
```

### Health Checks
- Built-in health monitoring
- Custom health check endpoints
- Automatic failover on failures
- Integration with monitoring systems

## Best Practices

### Security
- Use unique tunnel credentials for each environment
- Implement proper access policies
- Regular credential rotation
- Monitor access logs

### Performance
- Deploy tunnels close to your services
- Use appropriate service URLs (avoid localhost when possible)
- Configure proper timeout values
- Monitor tunnel latency

### Reliability
- Set up multiple tunnel instances for HA
- Use health checks for automatic failover
- Monitor tunnel connectivity
- Have backup access methods

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Connection failures**: Check firewall and network connectivity
- **DNS resolution**: Verify Cloudflare DNS settings
- **Service unreachable**: Confirm service URLs and ports
- **Authentication errors**: Validate tunnel credentials

### Debugging Tools
```bash
# Enable debug logging
cloudflared tunnel --loglevel debug run my-tunnel

# Test specific hostname
curl -H "Host: app.example.com" http://localhost:8080

# Check tunnel connectivity
cloudflared tunnel test my-tunnel
```
